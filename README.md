I'm an analytically-driven professional with a background in Mechanical Engineering and a strong passion for translating data into strategic insights. I began my career as a Supply Chain Analyst Intern at Gabriel India Limited, gaining hands-on experience in the automotive sector. After that, I worked at Tredence Inc. for over 2 years and 4 months as a Data Analyst/Consultant, where I predominantly supported Walmart. My work focused on solving complex business challenges through data analysis, process optimization, and strategic reporting.

To build on my technical and analytical foundation, I pursued a Master’s in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas. I’m skilled in Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Big Data, and Natural Language Processing. I'm especially interested in the intersection of AI and business, and I’m passionate about using data to drive smart, impactful decisions.
